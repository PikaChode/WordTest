Although maternal and infant death rates in China are not as high as in some developing countries (1),
they are still very high, about 300 per 100,000 deliveries for maternal mortality and 40 per 1,000 births for infant 
mortality in remote areas.
Many of these maternal and infant deaths may be avoidable if mothers/local health workers can learn how to better detect and manage 
pregnancy complications.
The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Promotion of Perinatal Care Program (2) contains teaching aids and texts for maternity care 
education.
These WHO materials have been validated and widely implemented in many regions worldwide, with various levels of successes.
