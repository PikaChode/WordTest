Although maternal and infant death rates in China are not as high as in some developing countries [1],
the rates in remote areas remain elevated, about 300 per 100,000 deliveries for maternal mortality and 40 per 1,000 births for infant mortality.
Many of these maternal and infant deaths may be avoidable if mothers and local health workers can learn how to better detect and manage pregnancy complications.
The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Promotion of Perinatal Care Program [2]
contains teaching aids and texts for maternity care education.
These WHO materials have been validated and widely implemented in many regions worldwide, with various levels of successes.
